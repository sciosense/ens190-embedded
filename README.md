# ScioSense ENS190 Arduino Library
Arduino library for the ENS190 CO2 sensor.

The ENS190 is a high-performance, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO₂ sensor designed
for precise and reliable carbon dioxide measurement. It complies with key regulatory
standards such as California Title 24, RESET, WELL, and ASHRAE. It is an ideal solution
for air quality monitoring in smart buildings, HVAC systems, and other indoor
environments.

At the core of the ENS190 is its patented "M-shaped" long optical path gas chamber, a
uniquely engineered design that maximizes the effective optical path within a compact air
cavity. This innovation, combined with a self-developed fully automated high-precision
calibration system, ensures exceptional accuracy, consistency, and a wide measurement
range. With its advanced sensing capabilities and robust design, the ENS190 provides a
solution for applications demanding high-precision CO₂ monitoring.
